Cleans up old and inactive forks on your GitHub account.

You'll need to create a personal access token with `repo` and `delete_repo`
permissions.

Then, [download the latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases)
and execute the binary as in:

```console
./fork-cleaner --token "my github token"
```

Fork-Cleaner will show you repos that:

- are forks
- are not private
- have no forks
- have no stars
- had no activity in the last 1 month

fork-cleaner will list them and ask if you want to remove them! Simple as that.

## Install

```console
brew install caarlos0/tap/fork-cleaner
```
