Cleans up old and inactive forks on your github account.

You'll need to create a personal access token with `repo` and `delete_repo`
permissions.

Then, [download the latest release](https://github.com/caarlos0/fork-cleaner/releases)
and execute the binary as in:

```console
./fork-cleaner --token "my github token"
```

Fork-Cleaner will show you repos that:

- are forks
- are not private
- have no forks
- have no stars
- had no activity in the last 1 month

It'll list and delete them for you!

If you want to check what it will do first, run it with `-d` or `--dry-run`.

## Install

```console
brew install caarlos0/tap/fork-cleaner
```
